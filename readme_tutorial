HELLO, WELCOME TO THE INTEL-OPTIMIZED CONTEXT IN WHICH TO RUN TENSORFLOW-PYTHON 
SCRIPTS.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               SHORT TUTORIAL:

    1)    PASTE IN THE CURRENT FOLDER THE SCRIPT YOU WANT TO RUN, ALONG WITH ALL THE
          OTHER REQUIRED SCRIPTS & FILES: YOU CANNOT REFERENCE STUFF OUTSIDE THIS
          FOLDER. 

    2)    NAME YOUR STARTING SCRIPT "main.py" 

   
    3)    RUN "bash run.sh" ON THE COMMAND LINE AND SELECT THE REQUIRED LEVELS OF CPU
          & MEMORY USAGE.

                               ---THATS IT*--
.....................................................................................
Your Script will now be running inside a CPU-&-Memory constrained docker container 
in an Intel-CPU-Optimized fashion

                               *TWO LAST THINGS
1. If you are using a non-standard library besides tensorflow, scikit, numpy, pandas, 
keras, mtplotlib, seaborn, pickle or json then you may need to add it to the 
self-explanatory file called "peat/requirements.txt". This solves the "missing library"
issue

2. Sometimes running "Docker" requires "sudo". Even tho runnng "sudo bash run.sh" might
be scary, I encourage you to open all the files and check for yourself that they are safe
