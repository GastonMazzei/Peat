.ISSUE 1: "Memory Buildup" 
.NOT SOLVED YET: 
Tensorflow backend (i.e. tensorflow.keras.backend.clear_session()) is being ignored so
multiple model-training will lead to a memory buildup 


** Example AI-Script is using the "Mobile Price Classification Dataset" from kaggle;
a well-behaved classification problem suited for a lightweight 10-neurons 2-layers 
~100-epochs neural network which was considered perfect for demonstration purposes
